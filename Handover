Attempted to modify the existing 2048 text based game to include a human player and a “random” player which chooses randomly selected moves to play the game 

Rationale - we already have the game written in simple python code to reduce computational issues that would arise from implementing the GUI version of the game 

Architectural design - utilised code from data and text module to allow the option to select between a human and a random agent as a player. There are now two methods in the game “def main_human_player():” and “def main_random_agent(): whereby the human one should accept input for the actions and the random agent should just select actions at random. 

The code at the bottom includes the option to select either a human or random player when executing the code in the terminal, the default is to make it a human player 

Implementation - utilise the terminal to select between the two players 

Performance evaluation - doesn’t work! when executing as a random player it asks for a prompt, it needs to select the moves randomly and play itself

Issues - as above, need to work out how to stop expecting an input prompt and accept the random players moves 

Next steps - continue to see if the random player can play the game and stop the expectation of the prompt. If unable to resolve, it may be better to implement the 2048 GUI and whether this can be “wrapped” as a gymnasium game via TF Agents - https://www.tensorflow.org/agents although we should also be able to wrap the text based 2048 game using this as well. Something to consider (and ask supervisor) is whether the text based version is a fair test of performance, if we are evaluating against human players who played on the GUI version.
